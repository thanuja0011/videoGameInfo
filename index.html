            <strong>A video game</strong> or <strong>computer game</strong> is
            an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface
            or input device (such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion
            sensing device) to generate visual feedback from a display device,
            most commonly shown in a video format on a television set, computer
            monitor, flat-panel display or touchscreen on handheld devices, or a
            virtual reality headset. Most modern video games are audiovisual,
            with audio complement delivered through speakers or headphones, and
            sometimes also with other types of sensory feedback (e.g., haptic
            technology that provides tactile sensations). Some video games also
            allow microphone and webcam inputs for in-game chatting and
            livestreaming.

            <b>Video games</b> are typically categorized according to their
            hardware platform, which traditionally includes arcade video games,
            console games, and computer games (which includes LAN games, online
            games, and browser games). More recently, the video game industry
            has expanded onto mobile gaming through mobile devices (such as
            smartphones and tablet computers), virtual and augmented reality
            systems, and remote cloud gaming. Video games are also classified
            into a wide range of genres based on their style of gameplay and
            target audience.

            The first video game prototypes in the 1950s and 1960s were simple
            extensions of electronic games using video-like output from large,
            room-sized mainframe computers. The first consumer video game was
            the arcade video game Computer Space in 1971, which took inspiration
            from the earlier 1962 computer game Spacewar!. In 1972 came the
            now-iconic video game Pong and the first home console, the Magnavox
            Odyssey. The industry grew quickly during the "golden age" of arcade
            video games from the late 1970s to early 1980s but suffered from the
            crash of the North American video game market in 1983 due to loss of
            publishing control and saturation of the market.

            Today, video game development requires numerous skills, vision,
            teamwork, and liaisons between different parties, including
            developers, publishers, distributors, retailers, hardware
            manufacturers, and other marketers, to successfully bring a game to
            its consumers. As of 2020, the global video game market had
            estimated annual revenues of US$159 billion across hardware,
            software, and services, which is three times the size of the global
            music industry and four times that of the film industry in 2019,[1]
            making it a formidable heavyweight across the modern entertainment
            industry. The video game market is also a major influence behind the
            electronics industry, where personal computer component, console,
            and peripheral sales, as well as consumer demands for better game
            performance, have been powerful driving factors for hardware design
            and innovation.

              PC Games
              <ul>
                <li>
                  PC games involve a player interacting with a personal computer
                  (PC) connected to a video monitor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Personal computers are not dedicated game platforms, so there
                  may be differences running the same game on different
                  hardware.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A gaming computer is a PC or laptop intended specifically for
                  gaming, typically using high-performance, high-cost components

              <ul>
                <li>
                  A console game is played on a home console, a specialized
                  electronic device that connects to a common television set or
                  composite video monitor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Home consoles are specifically designed to play games using a
                  dedicated hardware environment, giving developers a concrete
                  hardware target for development and assurances of what
                  features will be available, simplifying development compared
                  to PC game development.

                  A handheld game console is a small, self-contained electronic
                  device that is portable and can be held in a user's hands. It
                  features the console, a small screen, speakers and buttons,
                  joystick or other game controllers in a single unit.

              Arcade video Game
              <ul>
                <li>
                  An arcade video game generally refers to a game played on an
                  even more specialized type of electronic device that is
                  typically designed to play only one game and is encased in a
                  special, large coin-operated cabinet which has one built-in
                  console, controllers (joystick, buttons, etc.), a CRT screen,
                  and audio amplifier and speakers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Arcade games often have brightly painted logos and images
                  relating to the theme of the game.
                </li>

              Browser Game
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A browser game takes advantages of standardizations of
                  technologies for the functionality of web browsers across
                  multiple devices providing a cross-platform environment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  These games may be identified based on the website that they
                  appear, such as with Miniclip games. Others are named based on
                  the programming platform used to develop them, such as Java
                  and Flash games.
                </li>

              Mobile Games
              <ul>
                <li>
                  With the introduction of smartphones and tablet computers
                  standardized on the iOS and Android operating systems, mobile
                  gaming has become a significant platform.
                </li>
                <li>
                  These games may use unique features of mobile devices that are
                  not necessary present on other platforms, such as
                  accelerometers, global positioning information and camera
                  devices to support augmented reality gameplay.

              Virtual reality Games
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Virtual reality (VR) games generally require players to use a
                  special head-mounted unit that provides stereoscopic screens
                  and motion tracking to immerse a player within virtual
                  environment that responds to their head movements.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Some VR systems include control units for the player's hands
                  as to provide a direct way to interact with the virtual world.
                  VR systems generally require a separate computer, console, or
                  other processing device that couples with the head-mounted
                  unit.
